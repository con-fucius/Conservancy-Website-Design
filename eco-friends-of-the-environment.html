      <h3>Values</h3>
      <p>
        Our work at 'Everything Sustainable – Eco Friends of The Environment' is based on four values:
	</br>
	
	<br>Personal responsibility
	We take action based on conscience. This means we are accountable for our actions and take personal responsibility.<br>

	<br>Personal and organization goals
	Should a supporter be particularly passionate about a specific area of our work and ask us to use their donation to achieve that specific objective, we will try to honor their request.<br>

	<br>Integrity in funding
	We accept individual contributions and donations from corporations and agencies that share our goals and mission. That is our source of funding and we appreciate any donations made.<br>

	<br>Promoting innovation 
	We develop, research and promote concrete initiatives geared towards a green and peaceful future for all of us.<br>

	These values are reflected in all our social activities including campaigns, and they guide what we do, and where we do it.<br>

      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>
       Our mission is to: <br>
	•	Protect the environment from negligence and human encroachment<br>
	•	Prevent pollution of earth’s resources such land, air and water<br>
	•	Preserve the environment for the sake of future generations<br>

      <h3>Fundraising Principles</h3>
      <p>
        Our independence is vital for us to be effective in our campaigning work, which is why we have it as a core principle that guides all of our fundraising. <br>
	</br> Giving us donations allows people to stand together with our campaigners and our activists and help bring about much needed change.<br>
	</br> It is important that we treat merchandise from Everything Sustainable respectfully and responsibly, using them to create the biggest impact possible both in our campaigns and also when we invest in more fundraising. <br>
	</br> Sometimes we will ask supporters and the general public to donate to a specific project or campaign. When we believe there will be an expectation from donors that their money will be allocated in this way, we will use a recognised accounting method to track donations, and we will report on how much was raised and how it was spent.<br>
      </p>

      <h3>Transparency and Integrity </h3>
      <p>
       Everything Sustainable works actively to ensure transparency and public accountability in its campaigning, fundraising and financial management practices. We publish annual reports and weekly newsletter shared via email to update our supporters.<br>

<br>Our success at Everything Sustainable depends on building a movement of people with the courage and conviction to help build a better world. The strength as well as the integrity and reputation of the organization depends on the ability of its people to uphold and promote the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct. 
	The responsibility for upholding this integrity is shared and upheld by the cofounding team and each member. <br>
	This means we must have a strong framework to ensure our commitment to creating a working environment where people are not exposed to harassment, abuse, or discrimination.<br>
